  "description": "\"You're going to do everything Sunbae asks you to do, aren't you? Today, I'm taking Sunbae's place.\"\n\nWoohyeon is really, really happy these days.\n\nBecause he can cook and watch movies with Jeyoung... Isn't this just like a newlywed life? It bothers him that Jeyoung left home after having a fight with his older brother Jeyoon(a sunbae at work) but at the same time he feels happy because he can live together with Jeyoung. That is before he discovered which medicine Jeyoung is drinking.",
